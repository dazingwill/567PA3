# 567PA3: Neural Networks

This is the 3nd assignment for [USC CSCI 567: Machine Learning](www-bcf.usc.edu/~adamchik/567/) in 2019 Spring.

> For this Assignment, you are asked to implement neural networks. We will be using this neural network to classify MNIST database of handwritten digits (0-9).
>
> The architecture of the multi-layer perceptron (MLP, just another term for fully connected feedforward networks we discussed in the lecture) you will be implementing is shown in figure 1. Following MLP is designed for a K-class classification problem.
